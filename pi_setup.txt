sudo apt-get install chromium x11-xserver-utils unclutter

# setup ssh

ifconfig

# write down gateway and broadcast address for the wireless interface

sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces

# change the line “iface eth0 int dhcp” to “iface eth0inet static”
# directly after that, write:
#	address: 192.168.1.125 
#	netmask: 255.255.255.0
#	gateway: 192.168.1.1

# may need to also change /etc/dhcpcd.conf

# *** make sure address is not in the DHCP pool ***
# write this file and return to shell

# enable ssh:

sudo raspi-config

# change username and password - default is “pi” and “raspberry” respectively
# then go to option 8 and enable ssh

# on a separate computer on the same network, test ssh by using:

ssh pi @192.168.1.125

# enter the password that you set the pi to
# if it works, you have successfully enabled ssh

# disable screen saver and any energy saving settings:
# I don’t know if I want to do this just yet, if I am using touch screen, I will want it to sleep until you touch it/walk up to it

sudo nano /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart
# or: sudo nano /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart

# comment out the line that says “@xscreensaver -no-splash”

#@xscreensaver -no-splash

# add these lines underneath the line you just commented out

# *** here is where I will tell the system to load my page. I don’t know what language/how I will build the kiosk yet ***
# if I use chromium/HTML, add this line:

@chromium --noerrdialogs --kiosk http://www.page-to.display --incognito

# reboot the system:

sudo reboot

# may need to change boot_behavior setting in raspi-config to boot to desktop automatically
